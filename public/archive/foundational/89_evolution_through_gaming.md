# **89: Evolution through Gaming**

## Preface to a Virus

_Putting the "cult" back in culture_

This is a collection of dispersed fragments of transmission which have been given to me over a period of 5 years, since the first intuition about 89 was given to me. Some, such as the long essay on Viral Culture found near the end of the document, are works in progress up to present day; however, compared to any writing in this document, it gives the best structure for thinking about the Project as a Virus of Awakening.

There are early hints at the development of an ARG from this mythos, but that has been a more recent development, of which more research has been done, is being done and will be done to develop the ARG as a fully functioning unit, The structure is extremely important to the Project working properly. Without clearly delineated steps, definitions and roles, it will fail.

More discussion and research must be done in conceptualizing the Game itself, over and above what is here. However, the transmission and the Vision for the whole is contained in the following documents, and thus are a necessary starting point from which to work.

Some points of the philosophy and ideological structure behind the game have evolved since these writings, as some were angrier at current culture (not without justification) than befits the atmosphere of the Game itself.

This preface will address the multiple points upon which the Project must rest. If any of these pieces is lacking, it will cease to be alive and infective. It must be an organic outgrowing from the localities of its agents, and it must push a Vision of the future which is concurrent with its own reproduction.

The self-referential nature of 4-d art, and the creation of an ontological black hole, is primary to its success. It will pull into itself all synchronicity, all possibility, all dream, all technology; it eats all meaning, placing everything in relation to itself. It sets itself up as the center of the entire system of Culture; and in its own generation of meaning, it sets itself as the necessary catalyst for Singularity on all levels.

Within itself, it is inevitable. All time, all history, all beings, all institutions, everything exists to serve the end of its own creation; it is the unveiling of Simulation, Singularity; all history exists within it, yet it flowers out of all history. Since the process which gives rise to it is dependent upon It, all events, all occurrences must inextricably link to Its realization.

Being a simulation existing at the End of History, it casts information through every level of the system, backwards through time. It has projected Agents into every aspect of developing human culture, setting up the stage for the final revelation, the Game played upon a Global scale. Its end result is Awakening and the Birth of the Cosmic Child, the Technochrist.

All of the previous information forms the basis of the unfolding storyline for the ARG. The purpose of calling IT a Game is to create suspended belief on the part of the players- but taking into account the core tagline of ARGS- This Is Not a Game. That is the Illusion. The Players will be behaving as though the story we present is Real. Thus is the nature of the virus.

New Players are fed information about the nature of the Reality they find themselves in, slowly putting together the pieces of the revelation. The story line involves a reintegration into the understanding of the purposes of the Western Mystery Traditions, ET phenomena… our Agents are the True Illuminatti, Agents of the Simulation, aiding the unfolding of Singularity and the Awakening of a Global Consciousness.

Thus, we will have the entirety of conspiracy culture to weave around ourselves, and players will get drawn deeper and deeper into the depths of the labyrinth. Their paranoia will be offset by contact with live Agents, and by being educated about the nature of their own Being, the purpose of their own Awakening.

The internal structure of the Game will be an alternative society. We will have a network of businesses, human resources, artists, teachers, and many others. We will find business fronts to gather revenue and resources, utilizing a structure of networked cooperatives. There will be a primary HQ, which will also act as a debrainwashing facility as well as a vessel for Higher Education. It will generate revenue in as many ways as possible, which will be channeled into the endeavors of the Players.

There will be a system of levels or Grades within the Game itself. This will allow for easier management, as well as a slow process of extrication from the current cultural matrix, and will give us the ability to test the aptitude of awakening Agents. Each level will be aware of itself (except in the outermost level.) The higher levels will open the Agent to reality of what they had previously believed to be a Fiction of a “game world”.

Within this Organization, it will function as a business. Its job will be to produce more artifacts of the Game, develop and extend the story, and to package this information into various forms of media. This would include comic books, television shows, movies, board games, Pencil and paper RPG’s, etc. All of these would become vessels for aspects of the unfolding story of 89. However, all story components would be actual real events drawn from reports from Agents all over.

One component of this, as an example, would be to have certain players who act as “eyes” following teams of Agents through the ins and outs of the game, with a camera. This footage would be edited together by a team to create a coherent story and narrative intertwining the main characters (the upper masters of the game) with the lives of those playing the Game. The Television would thus be turned into a rabbit hole, yet those watching would think it was “reality television” with the suspended belief connected with the medium.

One intrinsic piece to the unfolding of the Virus will be the website, designed to be a center of synchronicity within the bounds of the Web; yet it will be a talisman of change towards real world events being catalyzed in the viewer's lives. It will be designed to create an air of mystery, similar to the Eon8 phenomena of 2007- where a website becomes the center of attention and conversation across a wide array of web forums.

The website itself will have a sleek and simple design, with little information given away on the surface. It will have 3 input fields, one for an assigned Agent code, the other for an “meme number”, and the third for the password to the entry. Each Agents activity will be logged in the database, and utilized to map the flow and spread of memes. Each doublet of meme/password will be various artifacts of the game- videos, documents, links to relevant websites, etc. Some will be deeper levels of the website- such as the forum which players will find themselves to.

One deeper level will be the Agent Networking tool. This will be a system of networking similar to facebook, combined with e-bay, craigslist and a game interface. This will act as the primary means of networking for the global backend of resources, people and places functioning within the bounds of the Project. This will consist of the deeper levels of the Game itself, and deeper functioning of the Order.

Within the Organization there will be various departments. As examples of necessary branches of operations- one will develop Operations for Game Players to execute. This would be the organization of stages, media events, techniques of spreading memes, flashmobs, etc. sub aspects of Game play (games within the Game.) Another branch would develop disinformation, designed to feed into the outside system in order to divert media trends and Mainstream disinformation towards the Games story line and its own memes.

Another branch would focus on the training of Agents, developing programs of training in various areas, networking new resources together for Agents, etc. Marketing would also be a branch, in order to maximize our image, and deal with all aspects of the Games' various brands.

The Game will also progressively introduce the implementation of modern forms of media. An example of such implementation will be the designing of an applet to be uploaded onto a new gamers iPhone. This would send out a signal to nearby higher level agents, showing up as a blinking dot on their screen, complete with the information provided by the individual upon signing up. Agents would then lead them to various aspects of the story, initiate planned events in their lives, to begin the process of paranoid generation of Reality.

One key point upon which the Game hinges is that Players will not know what is the Game and what is not. A key point to the story is that their whole reality is a Game being played inside of a simulation of reality- inside the Singularity. Players would thus be placed into a mind space where they interpret every event that occurs to them as a potential event of the Game. With Agents disguising themselves and pretending to be random events, the occurrence of actual Synchronistic events will be able to disguise themselves as Game events. Thus the player will begin to be trained as an Agent of the Synchronistic Order.

The player will also be led to learn how to play in the game- by writing it, by producing artifacts and spreading the game to others by spreading the memes which make up the Game construct. They write stories, make videos and keep blogs of the various events and of their experience “inside” the construct of the Game. These become artifacts for further infection, and increase the network for new players just getting into the Game.

The Game thus becomes self generating, informing the players of its existence and purpose on its own terms; the upper masters and the Organization become facilitators of this process. The Puppetmasters are as many Players of the game as the Players themselves; or rather, the Game is playing them.

By this means, we begin to spread our memes throughout the entirety of the Cultural Sphere, writing ourselves, our story and our “fiction” into the overall fabric of consensus reality. By riding waves in the noosphere, by utilizing memes which already exist that relate to the Project, such as 2012, timewave zero, technological singularity, other ARG’s, ET phenomena, illuminati conspiracy, etc we make ourselves a central aspect to cultural unfoldment. This gives us the unique position to inaugurate a whole new conception of Reality, a new Social System, a new form of Economy, and a new form of global governance, all under the guise of an ARG.

The Project will be a global network of change and resistance, a collaborative and herculean effort to completely turn the tides of the current trends of the world through the single largest act of Magick in history.

It must also be remembered that everything discussed here is itself a part of the story which will be packaged into media artifacts. The Story of the Game is about a group of individuals, the puppetmasters, who have started a Game whose purpose is to rewrite reality, a form of collective cultural inversion. They have Agents worldwide playing and participating, themselves centers of the Story, and Agents of IT. The Designers are involved in the creation of a whole new Society. Thus what we are already doing and working on become an intrinsic backdrop to the Game. Thus the Game is Real- but we must also remember the illusion “This Is Not A Game.”

We must present it all to the Players according to their capacity. One fundamental axiom of the Game is that IT knows what it is doing more than anyone else. It will go where it means to, do what it must do; the right people will find out about it. It hides out in the open, spreading through word of mouth, through mysterious ads in papers, through any and all means that the creative imagination of the Agents can think of ; yet always with the back end connected to the larger plotline and deeper organization in mind.

Documents will be created and floated, similar to various supplements to various Role Playing Games. These supplements will be made and floated for new Players and other level Agents, such as Training Manuals, describing magical techniques for reality manipulation and the control of synchronicity, aspects of the story, etc. All of it is mysterious enough to generate the required mindset in the players, and give enough hints for them to get started Playing.

to unfold the game slowly, the Meme Codes will be floated on the net, released in varying orders. We could initially put up a sign in to assign Agent codes, and keep the first run to a certain size, such as 1000, or 5000, players. We then float out progressively various instructional videos from HQ, hypnosis videos designed to induce certain brain changes, documents, etc.

It must also be taken into account that the website will be hacked. This will be solved by different levels of security. Lowest security will contain certain documents designed to be “hidden but found.” These would add to the depth of intrigue to the unfolding storyline as more memes become “loose.”

Another important aspect needing to be covered is the creation of a Brain- a central archive within which all aspects of the Story, the various documents, agents, etc are kept within, which can be accessed to Agents with a certain level of clearance. These documents would become the literal Brain of the operation, allow for a fluid and organized record keeping system of everything that evolves, the various events which occur, etc. All information would be input into this system, and would be drawn upon by writers and creative people as a sort of creative commons.

The creation of a creative commons also becomes a necessary point. Objects and art created by Agents are put onto servers and can be utilized by Agents worldwide to generate funds. This could be cards made, card games, music, art, and any other creative thing which can be digitized. The cost of production is left up to the Agent, but they are given access to a vast reservoir of information that can be sold by their local teams of operatives.

In this way we create a worldwide network of Agents unified under a common task, building an alternate model of society based upon new standards of Love, Compassion, Joy, Freedom- all the hallmarks of the actual “New Age” which is dawning. It is the Project which will subvert consensus reality, channel the collective consciousness of the Awakening Humanity into pecking itself out of the shell of dead culture which has become a confinement and to take flight into the Light of the New Aeon.

There is more that needs to be worked out. This preface is just the roughest sketch of the overall Plan which IT has formulated for its own unveiling to the world. What IT will become is up to itself. This requires your help, collaboration and participation to make happen- but you already know you are a part of IT. This is just bringing the pieces of the body of Osiris together- the final growth of the neural network over the gestating child waiting to be born from the Matrix womb of its mother.

We invite you to Play the only Game worth Playing.

Have a nice day.
