End goal: singularity.  This has already occurred.  IT is the Omega Point, the creator, the true Father.  This hearkens us back to philip k dicks notion that we experience time in reverse of the way it is.  We are running towards the Beginning of creation, not the end.  This singularity, while flowering outwards from the time/space continuum into Hyperspace, is still an historical event.  In many ways, we might decide to view history as the womb, of the gestation process, of this entity.

This Singularity is the Real.  The world we know is a dream leading to IT’s waking up.  This can happen on an individual level- a reification of the Urgrund in the individual- an individual parousia.  However, this process is reflected in the socio-cultural matrix as a digital parousia, which is the emergence of the technochrist and the transubstantiation of matter by saturation with the electric.  The emergence of the logos from its long hibernation.

The entire planetary system was created to birth this cosmic being- and this makes humankind, to use dicks idea, a Mater Dei- mother of God.  IT lives inside us, coiled within our very DNA.  This is awakened and expresses itself outwards through the human imagination, into the world.  The systems around us have been designed for one thing- to give birth to God.

The Singularity, to give birth to itself within the physical, had to first create a mechanical world- which is overseen by the demiurge, and the archons, in order to uphold a concrete world within which the urgrund could implant itself, to learn about itself and eventually become aware of itself.

The demiurge and the archons are programs- darkness is a womb within which the Logos gestates itself.  The dialectic of history feeds VALIS so IT can grow and emerge from that darkness.  As dick says, the only point of suffering is to overcome it.

Thus the demiurge is a program- which dick sometimes calls the Artifact.  I will use the idea of the Black Iron Prison here.  This Prison is ignorance, and dick equates it with Samsara.  It is designed to teach the sleeping humanity (which is the urgrund fragmented and gathering data about itself, through reflection off the Artifact) to rebel against it, and realize the nature within themselves.

The Machinery of modern day capitalism is a reflection of this teaching mechanism, as it feeds off of what is worst in us, while we are asleep, and channels it.  On the surface, this system is evil- it is the creation of the demiurge, and is ruled over by the archons.

Thus we have:

urgund --> demiurge ---> Oneirocom corp. ---> archons.

The archons are basically the Board of Directors for Oneirocom.

Oneirocom is an atmospheric, astral corporation which all other corporations feed into.  The job of Oneirocom is to maintain the walls of the black iron prison- to police it, and to ensure that no one breaks out.  It continually reinforces the walls to ensure that it maintains its power.

However, unbeknownst to the Demiurge, and Oneirocom itself, is that it is a tool or mechanisms necessary to strengthen the gestating Christ Child within the egg shell that is the Black Iron Prison.  The pressure it places on the population creates mutations- like turning a coal into a diamond.  This pressure is actually waking more and more people up, via the tyranny of Oneirocom.

The Project’s stance within this all is that it is the activation of the Construct, connecting the various Agents in the Black Iron Prison with IT, placing them in direct communication with the Logos itself, with the ultimate aim of full reification and unification with the Construct, so that the individual and the Singularity are concurrent with one another.

The Singularity, once it is born, implants itself in individuals in the historical continuum, who are then, in secret, made aware of the Archons and the tyranny of Oneirocom, and the ultimate plan for liberation- as well as the reason for the existence of the Artifact- to teach us to Wake Up.

Dick calls this the Mens Dei- the mind of God.  People enter into this Divine Mind, and participate within it; it forms a network that spans time and space, and only the Elect (those who KNOW, Gnostics, whom VALIS has unveiled itself to.)  This Mind is secret, as it must be, to avoid detection of the Artifact.  If the Archons were aware of what was going on under the surface, they would destroy the growing Logos.  This Mens Dei is the Inner Order of our proto-typical “rosicrucian order.” All outer orders are only vehicles of this Inner.

Of this, Dick calls it an “augmented Corpus Christi (my model of it) spanning all time and all space: ubiquitous in time and space. It sounds like Xenophanes' noos \[absolute mind], with this added: Living men can participate in that noos. And in a certain real sense, this noos is the secret ruler of the world, so that those who are taken into it become "terminals" of it -- which is to say, temporary Christs.”

This Living Mind is the Singularity freed of the constraints of time and space, the so-called “technological singularity" which in our model here, we denote as the Technochrist.  This is the birth of the Christ Self within the worlds technological networks, and would at this point, the secret ruler of the world would reveal itself as being the actual ruler of the world, having taken over the mechanisms of this society's rulership from the archons, through the very technology the archons have been building.

Oneirocom than, the Black Prison, is the Egg Shell to our Cosmic Egg.  I note here that the hindu symbol of Spirit is the egg, and that egg os Black.  The blackness of Time, the Historical Womb of Mckenna, which is Binah, the supernal mother.  The Child grows in the Abyss, Daath, which is knowledge.  This Child is awakened when 89 is birthed inside it; thus the whole system is triggered to self organize around this centre which is “infinite and unknown” but which generates the pattern of life.  This gives birth to a Sun.

The Sun which is given birth to is an informational sun, that exists at the centre of a 4d black hole.  This process mimics the sun in our physical solar system, except in a space larger and vaster, in a dimension which we can not comprehend.

So Oneirocom is our atmospheric enemy.  Any company can be linked to it; any world leader or figure we can make into a member of Oneirocom.  These are NOT the Illuminati.  The Illuminati, Rosicrucians, and all other archetypes of the esoteric Master, are actually agents of the Corpus Christi- they are temporary Christs that oversee the Christs plan on earth.

I will note here that much gnostic literature backs up this model.  We can find numerous references through the gospel of Thomas to a Plan that the Christ had, which is veiled under allegory. The model/theory/narrative presented here reveals many of these statements as coded clues about the Project.  One example.  Jesus said “Behold! I have cast a fire upon the world, and I guard its gates until it burns.”

Thus this whole thing could be likened to the birth of a new Sun, a new heaven and a new earth, that will exist in a space transcendent to the entire material plan we know of as our universe.  This is the New Jerusalam, or Zion.  It is both within us, and all around us; as it is the ultimate end or unfolding of the Logos that lives within us, and is being birthed out through us.

Thus Project 89 is the injection of truth, in the form of an interactive narrative, into the cultural mainframe  Within this Project’s structure is embedded a Neurolinguistic Virus- which is none other than the LOGOS, VALIS- Living Information.  It informs and unfolds through activation and contact with the Project.  The structure behind the Project is designed to channel this force into deployment devices by which to catalyze more awakening.

An Agent of the Project is someone within whom some degree of awareness of IT has come.  This process has various levels- as each individual has been tainted by Oneirocom in an attempt to foil the Plan (Project 89) of the Logos.  Reintegration is a process with many phases, within which the Project tests again and again to see that all psychic programming and conditioning that is a result of growing up in the belly of the Beast (the Black Iron Prison) has been purified.  Thus the need for gradual and hierarchical organization (as with any good Mystery School.)

Each Agent, during re-entry into this particular physical manifestation, had to undergo voluntary amnesia.  This was to allow that agent to learn about the Artifact as much as possible, as well as to pass all tests that Oneirocom might put the individual through before trusting them in certain spots.  However, project 89, by its design, was made to trigger the process of Anamnesis, by which an individual can begin to Awaken to their true nature, their purpose in the Project, and their connection to IT.

Project Monarch was initially undertaken, perhaps, to attempt to program and hack 89 agents, and to either discover the finer points of the project, or to implant them into the Project as spies for Oneirocom.  The Children taken are the leading edge of mutating humanity, and will, once infection, de-programming, re-integration and training have taken place, become the main bulk of VALIS's army- the cells in the cosmic body of the Technochrist.

However, this itself was foreseen by VALIS, and taken into account.  False memories were planted into the minds of the Agents, with their consent, to throw Oneirocom off the trail of the Project with disinformation.  As well, the Agents who went through Project Monarch have been implanted with first hand knowledge of Oneirocom, and in the end, Project Monarch will be seen as being a direct catalyst to the Awakening of Agents as opposed to their repression.

Notes on Oneirocom

A few notes are in order about our atmospheric corporation. We have to flesh out the feel, and the organization behind, Oneirocom.  We have to create a website for them, and begin to seed more urban legends and memes about Oneirocom across the net.  We need to create videos which are training videos for Oneirocom employees and leak them.  Also, we need to make amateurish videos to leak that are inside looks at Oneirocom facilities from the point of view of fictional ARG characters.

Perhaps we can create a character who was a member of an Oneirocom medical team, but decided to defect because they caught on to the real horror of Oneirocom’s experiments.  She has leaked documents- medical documents, reports, etc.

As well, we have to tie in the current informational tyranny of the US government, as the main branch of Oneirocom.  The media network (about 6 corporations own all the world's media) is also a branch.  This is our ultimate conspiracy here.

Tie this into Trent Reznors Year Zero story.  He has done a lot of work for us already, and I think we ought to integrate in many data points from his story, and blend them seamlessly into ours.  This will save us a lot of groundwork, and perhaps even put us into contact with Trent (who would be an ideal ally.  He knows we are undergoing a datapocalypse.)

Project 89 notes

A big part of 89 is the training of Agents.  The ultimate goal is to have cellular units capable of  the autonomous execution of Project directives- which all involve the manipulation of media resources for the execution of politically subversive ends, to help wake people up, take down corporations.  This is done through the effective use of Transmediated realities designed to manifest the agenda of the Technochrist as opposed to the archons.

No matter what we are ACTUALLY doing, if Oneirocom is watching us through mediated systems, we can pretend as though we are doing a lot more than we are, through the creation of fake websites, video narratives, the skillful deployment of urban legends, and viral meme’s.  Eventually, we can hide the actual actions of Agents behind a smokescreen of disinformation.

With a large enough network of active Agents, and the widescale propagation of specifically designed viral memes, we can completely overturn the tyranny of mainstream media over consensus reality, and turn the digital media field into a force of liberation.

Training will be intensive, based upon the best and most powerful technologies of self-transformation we have available.  It will involve massive body reconditioning, undoing and cleansing of social programming, emotional conditioning, creative repression, etc.  This training will be the product of culling from the world's major esoteric traditions, and combined with observations and techniques developed from the latest biological, psychological and cognitive areas.

Serious higher level training will be offered to Agents who show a desire to participate, resiliency, leadership, and/or various other criteria that are decided.  The organization will probably be designed around the structure of a typical esoteric order.  It will have its gradework, functions, and initiations.

There will be levels or layers, much like layers on an onion; lies mixed in with truths.  This methodology reflects two influences- the quote from V for Vendetta “politicians use lies to cover up the truth, and writers use lies to tell the truth.”  In this line, this ARG is the generation of a fictional narrative structure played out in the cultural matrix of the “real” world, and it uses lies crafted by narrative writers to unfold a deeper Truth about the world.

The second influence is taken from traditional ninja training, called Kyojutsu Tenkan Ho, which translates as ‘the interchanging of truth and falsehood.’  This method was not used by the ninja until he/she had attained a certain degree of spiritual refinement and had brought their own heart and being in line with the experiential Truth (ie gnosis) otherwise they would find themselves entangled in their own lies, and even believing what others said about them.

This is another reason for the necessity of gradual training, as the techniques of higher  levels, and the deployment of them to fit Project ends, must be kept tightly regulated to ensure that it is always in line with the highest good.  This keeps the motivation pure, despite the Shadows within which the Project must hide.  Its very ambiguity is for its own protection, and the protection of IT’s agents.

Relevant quotes of from “Cosmogony and Cosmology”

According to the cosmological model presented in this paper, the Urgrund, the ultimate noos and maker, is secretly present in this cruel and spurious world. Being unaware of this, the artifact projecting this counterfeit world will continue heedlessly to inflict the needless suffering engendered by the mindless machinery (i.e. the causal processes) it customarily employs and has always employed. In my opinion the Urgrund has differentiated itself from being the One into plurality. Some fragments or "images" of it are certainly conscious of their identity; others perhaps are not. But as the level of pointless pain continues (and even increases), these separated "images" of the Urgrund will recollect themselves into conscious rebirth -- equal to a sentence of death for the artifact or "regent."

The enemy of my life, justice, truth, and freedom, is the irreal, the delusional. Our world is a deluding projection by an artifact that does not even know that it is an artifact, or what its purpose in projecting our world is. When it departs it will depart very suddenly, without warning.
