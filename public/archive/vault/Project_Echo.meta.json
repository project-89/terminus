  "researchContext": "This research builds upon previous work in trauma-induced psychic phenomena, specifically the Echo Project and the Rhine Institute studies on emotional resonance.  It explores the hypothesis that extreme emotional trauma can leave behind measurable psychic imprints on the environment, analogous to residual haunting phenomena.  The primary goal is to develop reliable methods for detecting and interpreting these imprints for forensic purposes and potential therapeutic applications.",
