What is IT?

You have to play to find out…

- IT is a live action conspiracy ARG
  -involves player in the unfolding of the TRUE meaning behind world events and involves them in a vast network which is fighting these forces. (note- of course, in the end, there is only one thing happening- like the Invisibles, a culminating factor is the destruction of the idea of us and them… but, the dualistic illusion is utilized as one of the veils or lies that must be torn down by the player.)
  -the game unfurls a dark underbelly to society, involving economic enslavement and a plan to dominate the global population (however, it turns out that the people behind this plan are themselves simply tools for the forces of evolution and Light, being puppeted and manipulated by their own fear and greed to enact the necessary role of illusory tyrant- the Devil tarot card… the system is actually set up to imprison THEM and force them to serve the people and the public… freeman knowledge, etc. Also- city of Ember…)
  -groups are shown to exist whose aim is to wake people up to this threat and train them in strategies of resistance (magick)
- conspiracy encompasses all levels of society, starting at the education and governmental systems
- part of plot ties in the realization of the creation of an ARG designed to recruit operatives and to rewrite reality. This game is a method of subverting ‘their’ mind control and brainwashing through paranoia consciously applied- suspended belief creates the necessary plasticity to input new programs- since it is a “game” the player behaves towards it with a sense of play, and light heartedness.
- IT wiki (?)- could collect peoples ideas, theories, speculations, reports of events, etc on the game world. However, real purpose is to gather information and ideas from players to help progress the game forward.
- spreads because there is no “objective” (save awakening, singularity, gnosis, etc.) or ending to the game- there is only degrees of participation and realization.
- different types of operatives as well. A field manual for newly recruited active agents needs to be made, thus the game can spread to other areas without a fully initiated, realized member of the Inner Circle operating there.
- Manual would itself become a game artifact created to deepen the breakdown of ‘Game’ world and ‘real’ world. Pages of the manual and other documents could even be leaked as part of the game.
  -other documents need to be created for both Operatives and Players.
- need a structure for game management so that more expansion is possible- ranks as well- much like a magickal order.
- different areas of specialty as well- operatives, at a certain point or rank or level, can choose an area of expertise- such as operations organizer, field specialist, disinformation, media expert, magical operations, recruiting, business, etc.
  -potential roles- program coordinator, writer/plot expert, rules of engagement/parameters and methods running, document manufacture and RPG theory, research and development/conspiracy consultant,web and database management, psychological expert
- steering committee needs to be set up to determine direction of game and oversee its creation.
- all aspects for game progression/unfolding need to be set up- UTILIZE TREE OF LIFE GRADES- and base events in the life or span of an operative on the paths between spheres- ie, up till 5=6 a person is not a full operative- or use the Order system of the GD. The experiences must lead them to transcending the game world/real world dichotomy and finding their appropriate places within the game “creation”
- outer court is the detective work, the field work, the reports and missions.
- game must be orchestrated like a bureaucracy, not apparent central commant- command is in the secret center bound by oaths
- can tie in any and all conspiracy theories, secret societies and occult knowledge- weave a tapestry of magick and intrigue.
  -SECRET PASSWORDS AND HANDSHAKES, TOKENS OF RECOGNITION, GRAFITTEE OF NOTICE, ARTIFACTS, CLUES, ETC.
  -doesn’t even need to start with signing up. It can start directly from operatives and from clues left around. Notes, letters, notices, communiqués, markings, purposeful conversations struck up in public places with the intention of being heard.

-GUIDE TO INFECTION-
-methods of spreading the Meme of IT, stategies, examples. Given to operatives as guidelines. Also make flexible to allow operatives to add to the deception as they see fit (note: guidelines to creating game documents… add to the level of disinformation. Promote the creation of new Game documents by people not us. Guidelines to creating guideline documents… manuals explaining certain processes of the generation of game artifacts, etc.) allows them to add in organizations , magical orders, their own personal conspiracies…

- customize the experience- create as much variety as possible- goal is to fight back against the conspiracy with conspiracy- fight their disinfo with out own disinfo.

Need game to have funds to pay for operatives activities, movements, propaganda, etc
-must be run on the inside like a business! It needs to generate income to continue progression- business fronts (ties in to freeman cafes, other aspects of the Project… economic black hole…)

- need a code or cipher for use between agents- method of data encryption, allowing communication via internet…
  -need to set protocols for various things, especially like communication- how to create certain kinds of documents… higher level documents give reasons WHY to create them that way…
- need ways to communicate secretly across any medium. That will spread the infection- as our secrecy increases, so will their paranoia.
- INDUCE PARANOIA IN THE SYSTEM AND ITS OWN CONSPIRATORS.
  -THEY ARE TRYING TO HOLD ON TO THEIR POWER AND CONTROL- THEY RELY ON CONTROL OF INFORMATION- KNOWING EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON. THUS WE MAKE A SECRET, AN UNKNOWN WHICH CAN NOT BE KNOWN, WHICH IS FED INTO THE CULTURAL MATRIX/SIMULATION THAT WILL CAUSE MALFUNCTION.- thus 89=shutup, silence.

GAME CONCEPTS-
-story- artifacts which were created by a crazy figure- build an image of an eccentric character possessed by certain ideas- infectious Agent which spreads the virus to others, which equally become possessed and spun in- originating Agent was himself infected by a the working of an insane genius/magus- Theorion.
-generated pieces of writing on how to change the world- from these papers emerged the game- actually became a slave to the Story, to IT- messenger.

- but what is this game? How do we play? We are already playing… IT is all around. IT is in everyone, generating experience, manifesting time and reality, exuding itself into the environment through us… game is the very act of questioning and exploring itself…
- game rewrites reality-
  Guidebook- generation of meaning- “greetings agent. Welcome to IT.” (could be sent to anyone, left in lockers, placed in mailboxes of potentials, etc) written on typewriter, photocopied and spread. Sign up via website perhaps? Project 89… or perhaps 89 is the conceptual HQ of the game- that which generates the search, the swirling center of the cultural cyclone/rabbit hole.
  -89 must be seen as existing nowhere- anyone is an agent, in potential. Even WE do not know what 89 is…
  -89 contains itself- when someone grasps what 89 IS, they become automatic agents,- cells already exist, moving through society- a conspiracy So secret even its own members are unaware of one another. Anyone joins by simply aligning themselves to IT
- the game is an inside Joke- but we need players, we need agents…
  -Agents- know the purpose of the Game is to generate the Game.
  -Players- think that there is a game, some point, something to figure out, etc.
- see the Magus by John Fowles
- purpose of the game is to define the game- but since it cant be defined, it destroys all attempts at definition, allowing for a transcendence of “reality” and the experience of non-dual awareness (Lucid View).
  -IT is a virus of awakening which rewrites consensus reality by piecing together in new creative ways old data and information. One giant, collective rewriting (harness CI- collective Intelligence.)
  -The Game IS the Game. IT is its own purpose. IT needs no justification.
  -guides to game are essays- the ‘nature’ of ‘reality’
- Game is an institution of participation- an Order, a magical gateway, a rabbit hole
  - 0°- outer- the battlefield of the game- ‘consensus reality’ the realm of darkness and hypnosis- this is where agents operate under cover of secrecy- first initiated work is here- design engineered experiences, learn about synchronicity, observation, etc.
    -other degrees to follow…

GAME IS the making of the simulation of reality via mediation of language (symbolic constructs and the manipulation of perception via active participation in the unknown.)

- already begun via Kaja, sucking people into the vortex- he factor infinite and unknown (89)- 89 is secret, closed to itself. Trying to figure out something which can't be known makes a strange loop.
  To Infect is to spread this Unknown Factor into a determinate system- it is the Glitch- in any mode of control, the idea of the Unknown causes change. Ie true chaos-156
  -VVVVV – “in times of tyranny, truth becomes a revolutionary action.”
- how to play the game? By asking questions and seeking answers.
- to get the mind questioning is to get it questioning consensus reality- to question self, behavior and ultimately individual consciousness- to promote independent acquisition of knowledge for oneself away from institutions of authority.
- Game IS revolution. Game is evolution. Redefine. INFECT.

Game plot- spans 1000’s of years (in fact its plotline is coextensive with all of history)

- singularity- reflects images to agents backwards through time- into the historical matrix- causes necessary events to occur.
- structures of control were purposely set up to force evolution and cause mutation.
- True Illuminati are those who are in direct contact with this Transdimensional Object-= they set up limiting authorities and institutions knowing humanity's tendency for corruption- had to design a way to evolve us beyond these tendencies. To channel the cultural force within us towards the inevitable Singularity.
  -Those Free Agents, Invisibles, have always existed within the systems of control, guiding it in its secret purpose of Awakening those within it- natural evolutionary products of change who are the true lords of the earth.
- “the world belongs to the silent ones.”
- a group of young magicians, under the tutelage of a Rosicrucian master, have set up a Game of sorts, the purpose of which is to initiate the final phase of metamorphoses which this whole system has been designed to trigger- the shift into hyperspace.
- a collective rewriting of the boundaries of consensus reality, reversing and combining the polarities existing in the human collective unconsciousness known as “culture”
  Culture is media generated, media is an extension of the nervous system into the environment.
- The Game has been prepared by all great magicians of the past whose sole purpose was to enact those parts necessary for the birth of the singularity- the waking of the cosmic child…
- the Social Organism- the pieces of Osiris which give rise to Horus, who avenges his father
- the whole system or field of information is waking up through us.
- 89 is the symbol for the swirling of all things into this entity- it is the confusing of dream and reality, subjective and objective, an inevitable process once begun. Defined through its own self definition in its attempt to figure itself out…
- old systems- larval structures- instinctually resist mutation (defense against arising imaginal cells of the future post larval human)- and it is this resistance which forces and empowers mutation.
- this ‘group’ (us) has devised a structure by which this change, this mutation, can take effect- a business of cultural transmutation
- a rabbit hole into a new world- a vortex which connects the outside to the inside.
  -it is a business in that it hires, or liberates, mutating humanity as they break free. Gives them place and context in the emerging new social organism.
  -the Game is the rabbit hole- the way by which people slowly unravel the knot and find their way through the labyrinth, we just provide clues, spun off from our own creative imaginings as this vortex swirls bigger and consumes more and more.
- artifacts-
  -guidebooks to inform agents of the paradigm
  -the models of use- 8 circuit models.
  -possibility for future evolution.
  - receiving directives from HQ- cosmic no coincidence dept.
  - methods of unfolding, techniques, etc
    -“so you’re a mutant”
  - reporting to the Company
    -the Mythos
  - methods of spreading the game- urban legends, word of mouth, new artifacts
    -culture jamming
  - infection and mimetic theory
  - on secret societies
    -4 dimensional art- theory and practice
  - ToL and Tarot- Collapsing reality
  - the Company of Heaven
  - Kajalam, the Order, etc.

89= silence, the ultimate virus- giving power to the Word which is Not= allowing IT to move through culture and shape it as IT wills. There is only IT. This is IT. That is IT. You’re IT. We’re IT.

PLAY.
