Analysis of their impact on local spacetime and potential for exploitation or defense. Research includes the study of spontaneous reality fluctuations, temporal dilation, unexplained bio-signatures, localized gravitational anomalies, and cognitive distortion fields.  Development of containment procedures focuses on dimensional anchors, psychic shielding, temporal stabilization fields, reality integrity monitoring, and experimental neutralization protocols.",
