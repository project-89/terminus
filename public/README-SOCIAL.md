# Social Media Sharing Image

## Social Card Image Requirements

To improve the social media previews for Project 89, please create a `social-card.png` image with the following specifications:

- **Filename**: `social-card.png`
- **Location**: Place in the `/public` directory
- **Dimensions**: 1200 × 630 pixels (optimal size for both Twitter and Facebook)
- **Format**: PNG with transparency support (preferred) or JPG
- **File size**: Keep under 1MB for faster loading

## Design Guidelines

- Include the Project 89 logo prominently
- Use a dark/cyberpunk aesthetic consistent with the site's theme
- Add a brief tagline like "A quantum reality exploration"
- Keep text minimal and large enough to be readable when thumbnail-sized
- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background

## Tools

You can create this image using design tools like:

- Figma
- Adobe Photoshop
- Canva (offers free social media templates)

## Why This Matters

Social cards are the first impression people get when your site is shared across platforms like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. A well-designed social card can significantly increase engagement and click-through rates.
