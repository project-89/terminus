Project 89 Knowledge Base

Add Markdown, JSON, or TXT files here to seed LOGOS with structured domain knowledge.

Guidelines:
- Keep documents focused (e.g., lore, mechanics, policies).
- Prefer concise headings and lists. JSON is auto-rendered to bullets.
- Example files:
  - lore.md — core mythology and timeline
  - mechanics.md — mission types, scoring rubrics, director rules
  - ops.json — operational policies, codenames, contact flows

These files are loaded server-side and summarized into the system prompt context.
